My interests are focused on solving computational problems and implementing artificial intelligence models in low power processors,
always looking for new opportunities to build technology and contribute to the future.

Currently, I am part of the project **"Energy-Aware High-Performance Computing and Communications.
Applications to Computational Deep Learning"** at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
I am working as a graduate researcher in the Parallel Architectures Group ([GAP](http://www.gap.upv.es/)),
implementing artificial intelligence models in heterogeneous architectures under the supervision of 
[Enrique Quintana](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=YG8P9R8AAAAJ&hl=es)
and [José Duato](https://rac.es/sobre-nosotros/miembros/academicos/numerarios/965/).

Before this, I studied a Master in Electronic Systems and Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Valencia,
working on the project "Food state detection using neural networks".
